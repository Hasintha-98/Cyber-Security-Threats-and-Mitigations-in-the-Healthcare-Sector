In the health care environment, patient safety will always come before cybersecurity needs. Medical devices are becoming an essential component of medical networks and their security should be an integral component of cybersecurity protection. This will need greater cooperation between medical physicists and IT professionals, as well as collaboration by medical device makers and network suppliers. The cybersecurity vulnerabilities that are associated with medical devices are similar to those associated with any other networked system. Experts believe that shifting the protection of medical devices to more mainstream cybersecurity protection would need the adoption of these devices as conventional connections in network deployment. Health care organizations must understand the cybersecurity vulnerabilities that are already present in their networked medical devices. A coordinated proactive approach that includes standard cybersecurity assessment and control is needed. In the interim, there will inevitably be adverse outcomes for patient safety while a clear, workable process is developed.
